                        <p>Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.</p>

                    <p>What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.</p>

                    <p>Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess.</p>

                    <p> We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.</p>
