WEBSITE REDESIGN CASE STUDY:
KING TUT MEDITERRANEAN RESTAURANT


PAGE STRUCTURE & AESTHETICS
The original webpage displays an array of links for navigating through the site and for social media, each nav link taking the user to a separate page.  The landing page also has two rotating images of dishes that they offer, which also currently serves as their image gallery as their actual Gallery page is empty. The general design feels cramped, outdated, and appears clunky, especially due to the use of multiple and seemingly disjointed fonts.

For the new design, I chose a simple, single-scrolling layout since I feel that a restaurant’s site should be uncomplicated and streamlined, rather than requiring the user to click on various links to navigate through the site. I also wanted each section to stand apart from the others and offer something to the overall design.



COLOR SCHEME SELECTION
Yellow and orange tones are known to elicit a sense of hunger, and I felt that this would be an easy to incorporate into a Mediterranean theme.



LOGO
* Created with Designevo.com
* Font used is Marcellus SC
* Clean design intended to evoke a Mediterranean feel

The original website's logo felt dated and, for lack of a better word, kind of gritty to me. It seemed like the best place to start was with a warmer, more welcoming and updated logo.

The logo box coloration is a gradient from orange-red to yellow. This gradient evokes imagery of a setting sun, so I matched the navigation bar at the top to the top gradient color of the logo to make it look more harmonious in its initial placement. The navigation bar starts out with a matching color to blend in with the gradient, but as the user scrolls, the color shifts to a brighter yellow. This brightens the page and gives the nav bar contrast against the rest of the site design.



FONT FAMILIES
* "Redressed" for nav bar and headings
* "Arima Madurai" for the remaining body text (<p> tags) 

I utilized Google's Fonts API in order to expand outside of the usual web-safe offerings. 
I chose the above font families because both are cursive and complement the logo and the Mediterranean feel of the page.



NAVIGATION

— Sections included: About Us, Gallery, Menu, and Find Us —

As both designs are pretty straightforward, it made sense not to deviate much from the original navigation links. They serve the purpose of conveying what the restaurant is like, what they serve, and where to find them. However, for the sake of timeliness, I chose to remove the "Order Online" functionality from the new site design. The original site utilizes a 3rd-party menu and ordering system, and it didn't make sense to reinvent the wheel. That said, such a service could easily be incorporated into the new design if it were requested.

— ABOUT US —
The About Us section provides a description of the restaurant and the cuisine that they serve. I took this opportunity to include a bit more background and cultural influence in the new design. I borrowed a little information from the original site, included some text to reinforce the trans-Mediterranean influence of the restaurant's menu fare, and included a view of the Mediterranean coast from Cyprus.

— GALLERY —
Sadly, the original site's gallery was empty, so I set off on a quest to find incredible food photography to include in my experiment. I included stock photos of ingredients commonly used in Greek, Egyptian, and Syrian cooking, as well as popular dishes listed in the original site's menu. My goal was to convey a sense of freshness, health consciousness, and artful food preparation. The new gallery's images could easily be replaced or the gallery's size adjusted.

— MENU —
The original site's menu sections linked to their outsourced online ordering service. As I had opted not to use a similar service for the new site design, I decided to include viewable sample menu photos on the site instead.  

— FIND US —
On the original site's Location page, they have included standard contact information, a note about deliveries, hours of operation, and a Google Map. For the new design, I used much the same information with a few small textual adjustments and centered the content to match with the rest of the new design. I also incorporated a more updated Google Maps API that is more suited for directions and visual landmarks, and even includes the restaurant's ratings and reviews, rather than just a simple address.



BUILT-IN FEATURES

* Navigation:

  * I created a sticky navigation bar that adheres to the top of the page and follows the user as they scroll down the page in case they want to navigate to another section of the page.

  * I also Implemented a jQuery plugin to allow users to click a link and skip to that link’s corresponding section of the page (ex. the Menu button sends you down to the Menu section of the page). This gives the user the option to scroll from top to bottom or skip to the area they’re currently interested in viewing.

* Gallery: I implemented a simple tabbed image gallery and used stock food photos from Pixabay.

* Menu: For the sake of conserving time, I found a stock, customizable menu and inserted that as the Menu example rather than recreating the restaurant’s menu from scratch. Any menu image could easily replace the example menu.

* Find Us: I added a Google Map including the restaurant location and directions functionality. I utilized Google Maps' embedded API.



CHALLENGES
I struggled to find a simple jQuery gallery that didn’t clutter up the code tremendously or include simple features. I decided on the tabular gallery since it is clean, simply implemented, and easy to customize.



SUMMARY
This was a really enjoyable project that gave me the opportunity to sharpen my front-end developer skills and learn some new tricks. I learned how to overcome some interesting hurdles and really enjoyed exploring my creativity further. It was also fun to explore different design tactics, dig through stock photography, and bring my vision for the restaurant into being. This was both my first full website redesign and first case study. I look forward to starting a similar project in the near future. 

I hope you've enjoyed traversing my experiment! Thank you for visiting.
